## Student Application

This was the first Android project I developed during my first year of school. The objective of this application is to manage the HBO-ICT students at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. The app is devided into three main courses: 'Software Engineering', 'Business' and 'ITSM'. Each course has a list of classrooms and each classroom has a list of students. Each student has its own list of subjects where they can add or delete subjects and the corresponding grades for each subject. Furthermore the user can visualize the percentage of students that follows each course.

## Things I've learned with this project:

* How to work with multiple activities and pass data from one activity to another;
* How to create my own compound controls to add custom behavior to my application;
* How to make custom and dynamic custom drawings that adapt to the current state of the application data model;
* How to create custom dialog fragments to receive input from the user;
